Sari is a localized programming language designed to make programming more accessible to Filipinos. It integrates Filipino language elements into Pythonâ€™s syntax to reduce reliance on English keywords, a common barrier for non-native English speakers learning to program. Sari's context-free grammar (CFG) is carefully designed to define the structure of the language, enabling Filipinos to learn programming in their native language. This integration aims to lower the language barrier and empower more Filipinos to participate in the growing technology sector. Initial survey of Sari with third-year computer science students found a high likelihood of adoption and overall positive sentiment toward its usability.
